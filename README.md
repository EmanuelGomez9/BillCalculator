Bill and taxes problem solved with Javascript, HTML and CSS

Instructions:

- Just download and open the html file in any browser.

Notes:

- I chose to do it with an HTML template because it is easy to open basically anywhere.
- No need to run / install any code, can be really customisable if wanted to use lot of CSS.
- Values are easy to optain from inputs.
- I let some notes in the Javascript in case wanna know my logic behind those parts.
